# This is a React.js showcase.
### I made this project while in my bootcamp (Henry), its only real functionality is to preview my frontend and backend skills with a pokedex-like or wiki-like appearance with a REST api that provides characters from the popular show Rick and Morty.
---
### It is still in progress, so some of the frontend may change, and the backend will be completed.
