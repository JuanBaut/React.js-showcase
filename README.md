#This is a React.js showcase.
I made this project while in my bootcamp (Henry), its only real functionality is to preview the frontend and backend with a pokedex-like or wiki-like appearance.
---
It is still in progress, so some of the frontend may change, and the backend will be completed.

Dependencies:
- react-router-dom
- react-redux
- material-ui
- axios
- fontsource/rubik
